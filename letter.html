 <h2> <em>Re: Eileen Dover applying to college</em> </h2>

<p> Dear Eileen,</p>

Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Faculty of Science at Université Génialissime 
to <br> study for your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections. <br>

<p> Start dates</p>

<p>
We are happy that you can start your studies  with us at any time,
 but we prefer that you start  at the <br> beginning of a semester; 
 the start  dates for each semester are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <em>
   <li> First semester: September 9, 2016 </li>
   <li>Second semester: January 15, 2017 </li>
   <li>Third semester: May 2, 2017 </li>
</em>
</ul>


 <p> Please let me know if this is right for you, and if so, which start date you prefer.<br>
You can find more information about important university dates on our website. 
</p>

<p>Study subjects </p>

<p>In the Faculty of Genius Sciences, we have a great openness in research,
 as long as the subjects fall <br> within the field of science and technology. 
 You seem like an intelligent and dedicated researcher,
  just the <br> kind of person we would like to have on our team. That said,
   among the ideas you submitted, the ones <br> that intrigued us the most are the following, 
   in order of priority:
</p>

 <p> Turning H <sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of resveratrol 
    (C <sub>14</sub>H <sub>12</sub>O <sub>3</sub> ). <br>
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures above 30°C (86°F),
 when <br> audience size increases exponentially (effect from 3 × 10  <sup>3</sup>  increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4.</sup>) <br>
Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.
</p>

<p>
Can you provide us with more information on each of these topics,
 including the expected duration of the <br> research, the staff and other resources needed,
  and anything else we should know? Thank you.
</p>
<p>
Please accept, Madam, the expression of my distinguished sentiments, <br>
<strong>Dr Eleanor Gaye</strong>  <br>
